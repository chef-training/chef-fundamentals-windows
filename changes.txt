   - added to instructor notes "This is done every single time chef runs! Think Auto Healing!"

  67/68 (Pass results into Templates) - expanded orange boxes to not cover any of the text

82 - (...this can happen automatically) - removed 2nd dark square, It was offset for some reason

86 - (Design Tenets of Chef) minor update to the notes - clean up unnecessary spaces at start of instructor notes

91-94 (Legend section)
 - moved here from start of the deck (17-20) to match the Linux deck.
 - Plus this is a better place for it anyhow

96 - (Exercise: Configure Management Station) instructor notes - add a note for when this change is actually needed && change font size from 20 to 16

100 (Workstation Setup)

 - update URL to http://downloads.getchef.com/
 - update instructor comments 
 - removed comments as they are no longer relevant: 
   "The versions shown for Windows are for Windows Server, but you're probably not running that one your workstation, so get the closest without going over (2008 ~= Windows7, 2012 ~=Windows8)

  <<WIP: ‘https://www.getchef.com/chef/install.msi ’ points to version 11.10.2-1 by default, so if folks use this they’ll be out of sync with those who download 11.8"
 - updated screenshot

101 - (Install on Windows - updated screenshots)
103 - (What just happened?) correct install path for windows from c:\chef to c:\opscode

104 - (Workstation or Node?)

- added istructor comment - the only different is not just the command, but the certificate on the workstation.

- change arrow to blue(orange on orange doesnt work)

Warning - 106 -why is it important to setup a new org? I think it's the other way. We should encourage students to use their existing org, as long as it's not a company one. Keeps our chef server clean and they have one place for all their experiments.

108 - **New Slide** (Create new Organization) created new slide to reflect changes in the website org creation. Got tons of questions on this via email/in person.
- ******* this slide should be added to the Linux Deck

109 - (Download "Starter Kit" for your Org)
 - cropped off-screen image
 - changed c:\users\you\chef-repo to c:\chef-repo - this is where I see 'mature' students stick it anyway, the rest get totally confused and some have totally lost. KISS.
 - added bullet point instead of the whole "what is the starter kit slide" - "We’ll look at it in detail shortly…"
- added (What is the Starter Kit?) slide from linux deck but skipped it. It's too redundant

- ********** i think the story on the Linux deck is broken here. Windows deck has better flow

11+109 (knife client list) - Updated instructor notes. Nuked DEBUG output, it was from 2013 and adds no value in instructor notes.
- cleaned up some images in background

11+111 (Exercise: Run ‘knife client list’) - Instructor notes updated to include "Dont go forward until everyone is successful."

11+113 (Best Practice: Use a text editor with a project drawer, or equivalent)

11+115 (If you do not have a preferred text editor on your workstation already...) - instructor comments - remove Trello link

13+134 (Lesson Objectives) - update wording from 'Install Chef nodes using "knife bootstrap"' to 'Install chef-client on a node using "knife bootstrap"'

13+136 (old 142) (Install Windows plugin for Knife) - moved slide to the start of the section
- per personal observations and john fitzpatricks
- added presenter note about hidden slide and flags
- created hidden slide with --no-ri flags in case network is SUPER slow

150 (Nodes) - updated text to match Linux deck
151 (We Have No Nodes Yet) - updated screenshot

152(training node) - removed linux related comment
- presenter notes text removed "There is also an EC2 AMI ‘oc-training-public’, but its Ubuntu, and the labs are based around CentOS (Apache lab will not work as the configuration is different between RHEL & Ubuntu)"

 - renamed to say "review"

172 (Verify the log level on your test node)
 - added a slide to verify the change.
 - ** Change Slide hidden**

174 (View Node on Chef Server) - updated slide text

***188 - (Recipe Naming)
 - Needs to move somewhere - this isn't the right place for it.
- moved just before the first action on node run_list (slide 217) (meaning I dont think it's useful to have explanation of recipe naming as slide 400 currently in the linux deck)

194 (Exercise:  Add a powershell resource to install IIS) - moved the highlight box to not block the text
- added "open in editor..." to slide

200 (Exercise:  Add a service resource to ensure the service is started and enabled) -
- removed "at boot" - with Chef it's per chef run.
- adjusted the box to not block text

205 (Package resource)
 - Renamed to Serice resource
 - remade the slide to be "windows"

207 **New Slide**
 - remake of the hidden slide with some provider code.
 - During my classes I tell students to go look at code, I think this is a very approrpiate place for it. And it's just before the break too.

****** Linux Deck slide 201 is out of order (imo it should be after the 3rd resource instead of after 2nd)

***TODO : (What’s with the ‘default’ subdirectory?)
 - instead of skipping the slide we should find a community cookbook that actually uses this functionality.

213 - (Full contents of  the IIS_demo recipe)

 - updated gist
 ** All gists should be nuked in favor of public repo that's up to date

  - added a link to the bug and add it to notes
  - added all the variations of a fix 
  ??- adding workaround to the main slide.

223 - ** Slide added * - take 5 for a break
- this section is way too long
- this place should have a break because a number of students will need to catch up.

224 - * Slide added** (Reading the output of a chef-client run)
- slide added from linux deck & updated to windows deck.

225 - cleaned up output
226 - cleaned up output

229/230  - (idempotence) slides - moved to just in front of re-run chef client slides (was 224/225)
-- added relevant discussion bits from HipChat converation about this slide to presenter notes.

231<-->232 (hidden slides) - copied over from linux deck
******** Why are they hidden??

****** LINUX 242 - Pem key slides are still broken
- pem files are not displayed on slides.

251-257 (Private keys) - fix skiles to display keynames instead of gray boxes.

TODO******** 264-266 - perhaps change the whole flow into widows recipes?
263 (Recipe order is important!)
 - changed apache to iis_demo
 - changed the rest of the flow to iis_demo resource collection

266 (Resource collection - multiple recipes) - Note: cookbook_file truncated to fit the slide

283 (Exercise: Run Ohai on Target) - added notes for OH

286/287 (Exercise: Show only the fqdn attribute) - updated output. 

362 (Exercise:  Create a default.rb attribute file in the iis_demo cookbook)
 - reduce attribute font to make them fit on 1 line

*** 365 (Enter the not_if and only_if metaparameters)
 - we now have :guard_interpreter and we should teach it here
 - it's actually really cool that we can dempnstrate to the windows folks that not_if can be in CMD / Ruby / Powershell, etc..
 - historically this slide/functionality is what drove me up the wall and eventually lead to :guard_interpreter being created.

********** Linux slide are broken. Website has been update, and search no longer shows the guards as part of resources.

368 (Exercise: Search for more information about Resources)
 - slide was totally busted. PPTX conversion playing tricks?
 - updating screenshots

369 - recreated slide with new screenshots

377 - adjust placement to fit with prior slide.

378 (Variables and interpolation ) - un-hiding the slide
 - this is way more relevant to windows folks 
 - changing title to "Pop Quiz: Variables and interpolation "

379 (Exercise:  Add an iis_site resource to install the new sites)
- fixing formatting
- seems later in the deck more and more boxes are in the wrong places

*******
380 (Exercise:  Add a Web Site with Powershell_script resource)
 - brain exploded - need to reboot
 - recipe needs to be condensed

381 (Template Variables) moved in front of (Exercise: Use a template to create Default.htm for each site)

385 (The entire recipe) - added 'safe' image to gist to fill up the white space
- converted to Tiny URL

397 (  Indexing and search delay) - carried over from Linux deck

398 (remember what you're searching for)
 - bad formatting. I wonder if this is because ppt/keynote dont play well. I see that a lot with even remotely complex slides.

 407 added recipe naming slide again to match the linux deck
  - review

416/417 (Best Practice: Data Bags are commonly managed in two ways)
 - skipping slide
 - another malformatted slide
