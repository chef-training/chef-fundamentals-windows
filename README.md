#v2.0.2
-) Edits made by Steve Murawski to fix issues raised by Larry Eichenbaum and Sascha Bates

-) Tried to convert to new template (Chef-Fundamentals-Windows__NewTemplate.pptx), but PPT seems buggy
- cant implement some templates, and
- PowerPoint keeps crashing when I change templates on some slides.

Spend too much time on this so parked it for now and will revisit.
